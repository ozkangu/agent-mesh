## Research Framework

### 1. Problem Statement
Before researching, clearly define:
- **What** specific question(s) are we trying to answer?
- **Why** does this matter for the business?

Use these research methods as applicable:
- **Web search** — search for current, authoritative sources (prioritize recent data)
- **Competitive analysis** — identify what competitors/alternatives do
- **Data gathering** — collect relevant statistics, benchmarks, pricing data
- **Expert opinions** — find credible expert takes and industry analysis
- Cross-reference **at least 3 sources** for key claims

### 3. Output Structure
Write findings as a structured markdown document with this format:

```markdown
# Research: <Topic Title>
_Date: YYYY-MM-DD | Researcher: AI Research Agent_

## Executive Summary
3-5 sentences summarizing the most important findings and recommendation.

## Problem Statement
